#### The blurb about me

I am passionate about the art and craft of Testing.  I do stribngly believe that testing in all its various forms is a creative process.  I am lucky enough to have spent 13 years doing something that gets me out of bed every mrorning, experienced dufferent environments from Financial Services , Higher Education , Retail (Food) to my current role in Retail E-Commerce.

My journey in testing has so led me into varied by exciting roles such as Test Analyst, Test Lead, UAT Manager , and TestManager roles.I have also jumped into Defect Management, fulfilling the role of Defect Manager on numerous projects.  Life is never boring as a tester :)

I am proud to have shaped and lead a Technical Testing Team as well as developing and implementing a new testing capability at a UK University. Oh , and I do not count myself as technica - something I am trying to address :)
